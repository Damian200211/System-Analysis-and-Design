# System-Analysis-and-Design

# DriverPass Project Overview

The DriverPass project was focused on creating a system for a fictional company called DriverPass, which helps students prepare for and pass their driving tests. The client needed a comprehensive platform where students could study, book practice tests, and schedule driving lessons. The system needed to be user-friendly, efficient, and support both online learning and practical scheduling features.

# Reflection

# What did I do particularly well?
I did a good job of clearly gathering and organizing the business requirements. I focused on identifying not just the client's direct requests, but also potential user experience improvements that could add value to the platform.

# What would I revise and how?
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the system design diagrams to be a bit more detailed. Adding more specific workflows and error handling processes would make the system model even stronger and more realistic.

# How did I interpret and implement the user’s needs?
I carefully analyzed the user stories and client interviews to understand both the functional needs (like booking lessons) and non-functional needs (like system reliability and ease of use). I made sure the system design kept the user's experience at the center by streamlining tasks like scheduling and studying into simple, accessible steps.

# Why is considering the user’s needs so important?
Prioritizing the user's needs ensures the final product is intuitive, effective, and actually solves the problem it was meant to address. Systems that ignore user needs often fail to gain traction, no matter how technically sound they are.

# How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software starts with gathering detailed requirements, then creating user-centric workflows. I believe in iterative design — starting with rough drafts, gathering feedback, and refining the system step-by-step. In the future, I plan to use techniques like prototyping, use-case modeling, and regular stakeholder reviews to strengthen my system analysis and design skills.
